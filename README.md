# The structure of the hematopoietic system can explain chronic myeloid leukemia progression
This repository provides the data and the code necessary to reproduce the results published in the article:

**Include link to the article**

The repository is organized in the four following folders:
- cml_simulator
- simulated_data
- manuscript_figures
- figures_creator

## cml_simulator

## simulated_data

## manuscript_figures

Five figures are currently included in the manuscript
- mutational_dynamics.svg 
- schematic.eps
  - This figure cannot be reproduced from any code.
  In the figure we represent qualitatively CML progression.
- median_durations.eps
- hierarchical_model.eps
  - This figure cannot be reproduced from any code.
  In the figure we sketch the hierarchical structure representing the hematopoiesis.
  We also present the interaction between the bone marrow and bloodstream,
  and the effect of the driver mutations on the cell rates.
